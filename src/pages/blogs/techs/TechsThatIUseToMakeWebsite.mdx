# Techs That I Use To make Website

As a frontend developer i use some techs to make good and respnsive website.

## Languages
Of courese I use three basic languages. There are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is really helpfull for me to be a frontend developer.

1.  **HTML**: I still learn how to make good website with **semantic HTML** beacause it is so important for its perfomance and of course, *SEO*.
2.  **CSS**: Since i learn css fameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), i still learn how to write vanilla css with my own code.
3.  **JavaScript**: I think, this language is still worth it to learn to make fullstack web app. For me, while I learn this programming language, i still can make *server side app* and *client side app*.


When i started to learn programming, i learned these first three tech stacks. And i found out that i like to be a frontend developer. although i like it, i also learn backend developmen, and i learn its programming language like PHP.

## Frameworks and Library

I have been learned and tried frontend frameworks and library and they are really helpfull for me to make website fastly.

1. **React**: It is a popular library for making website based on a component. One thing that i like with React is I don't need to make separate file between HTML file JavaScript file to make an interactive component.
2. **React Router**: When i am working with React, sometimes i need to make route for multiple pages. That is why i choose **React Router** to handle the routes.
2. **Tailwind CSS**: A lot of modern website styles with **Tailwind CSS**. And it is really flexible to style your component with your style.
